================================================================================

STEP 1)
	Unpack ListMessenger Pro 2.1.0 with any upzip / untar program. The
	extracted directory will be named "listmessenger-pro-2.x.x" or something
	to that effect; it would be a good idea to rename this extracted directory
	to "listmessenger", "mailinglist" or something similar.

STEP 2)
	Modify the contents of ./includes/config.inc.php to reflect the correct
	database and database login information for your MySQL Server.

	<IMPORTANT NOTICE>
	While the ListMessenger setup program will create the database tables that
	ListMessenger needs to run, it will not create the actual database for you,
	please create it yourself before running the setup program using a database
	management tool such as PHPMyAdmin or through your hosting control panel if
	you have one, such as Plesk, Ensim, cPanel, etc.
	</IMPORTANT NOTICE>

STEP 3)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to a web-server which meets the following system requirements:
	-> PHP 4.1.2+ (4.3+ highly recommended)
		\_ PHP's short tags must be available.
		\_ PHP 4.3+ is required for importing and exporting.
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MySQL 3.23.23+ (more databases on the way)

	Also upload your ListMessenger Pro 2.1.0 Licence Key file (key.php) to the
	listmessenger application directory root.

	<REMINDER>
	You will require your Authorisation Code that you received in the welcome
	key e-mail when you purchased ListMessenger Pro during the installation.

	ListMessenger Pro is licenced on a per-domain basis.
	</REMINDER>

STEP 4)
	The folling directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 5)
	Point your web browser to the ListMessenger setup program located in
	the ListMessenger program directory and follow the on-screen instructions.

	Example: http://www.domain.com/listmessenger/setup.php

STEP 6)
	After the installation has been completed, make sure you delete the
	setup.php file AND setup directory from the ListMessenger directory root.
