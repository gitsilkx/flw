================================================================================

*IMPORTANT:
If you are upgrading from ListMessenger 2.0 to 2.1, then I have created a
separate upgrade file called upgrade_2.x.txt in this directory to review.

================================================================================

ListMessenger 0.5.0 - ListMessenger 1.0.0:

STEP 1)
	Backup your existing listmessenger database. Do not continue unless you
	have a valid backup of your existing listmessenger database. If you do
	continue without a valid backup and something goes wrong, we may not be
	able to help you restore your existing installation.

	You can create a backup of your existing installation by using PHPMyAdmin
	or any other database management tool's Export feature. Alternatively,
	we can upgrade any installation for a nominal fee, please contact us.

STEP 2)
	Now that you have backed up your existing installation's database:

	Login via FTP to your webserver and rename your current listmessenger
	program directory to "listmessenger_backup" or something to that effect.

	In doing this, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, it will be very
	simple for you to revert back to the original version while seeking
	assistance from technical support.

	Example, if your current listmessenger installation is running at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger

	Rename the listmessenger directory to listmessenger_backup, so that
	it exists (non-functioning of course) at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger_backup

STEP 3)
	Unpack the ListMessenger Pro 2.1.0 distribution file with your favourite
	upzip / untar program and rename the extracted directory to "listmessenger"
	or whatever your previous installations directory was named.

STEP 4)
	Modify the contents of ./includes/config.inc.php to reflect the correct
	database and database login information for your MySQL Server. This
	information should be the identical connection information that was in
	your previous versions config.inc.php file.

	If your database connection information is not exactly as specified,
	the upgrade script will not detect you had a previous version and will
	therefore install a clean installation.

	<NOTICE>
	ListMessenger 0.5.0 - ListMessenger 1.0.0:
	Do not overwrite this config.inc.php file with the config.inc.php file
	from your previous version, the files have changed and will this cause
	you confusion when you receive errors.
	</NOTICE>

	<TIP>
	If you previously specified a table prefix (in the TABLES_PREFIX
	constant) don't forget to add this to the new version as well.
	</TIP>

STEP 5)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to the same directory name as your previous ListMessenger installation
	was under, on a web-server which meets the following requirements:
	-> PHP 4.1.2+ (4.3+ highly recommended)
		\_ PHP's short tags must be available.
		\_ PHP 4.3+ is required for importing and exporting.
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MySQL 3.23.23+ (more databases on the way)

	Also upload your ListMessenger Pro 2.1.0 Licence Key file (key.php) to
	the listmessenger program directory root.

	<REMINDER>
	You will require your Authorisation Code that you received in the welcome
	key e-mail when you purchased ListMessenger Pro during the upgrade. If
	you no longer have this e-mail, you can log into the ListMessenger Members
	Area and resend the key to yourself which contains the Authorisation Code.

	ListMessenger Pro is always licenced on a per-domain basis.
	</REMINDER>

STEP 6)
	The folling directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 7)
	Point your web browser to the ListMessenger setup program located in
	the ListMessenger program directory and follow the on-screen instructions
	to upgrade to the current version.

	Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger/setup.php

STEP 8)
	After the upgrade has been completed, make sure you delete the
	setup.php file AND setup directory from the ListMessenger directory root.

	After you have verified everything is working correctly with your new
	version you can also delete your old listmessenger_backup directory.
