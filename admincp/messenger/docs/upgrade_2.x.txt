Author:		Matt Simpson <msimpson@listmessenger.com>
Tab Stop:	4 spaces
================================================================================

*IMPORTANT:
This file is for users upgrading from ListMessenger 2.0.x to 2.1.0 only. If you
are upgrading from a previous version, please review the "upgrade_1.x.txt" file.

================================================================================

SHORT VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

1)	Always backup your ListMessenger 2.0.x database before upgrading.

2)	Make sure you've logged out of ListMessenger and have closed your
	web-browser (to make sure session data is clean upon upgrading).

3)	Rename your old ListMessenger 2.0.x application directory to
	"listmessenger_backup" or something to that effect:
	Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger_backup

4)	Upload the ListMessenger 2.1.0 application directory to your webserver
	using the same directory name as you had with ListMessenger 2.0.x.
	Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger

5)	Copy the ListMessenger 2.0.x "config.inc.php" from the
	"listmessenger_backup/includes" directory to the new 2.1.0 "includes"
	directory or just edit the new config.inc.php file with the same vales.

6)	Copy the ListMessenger 2.0.x licence key file "key.php" file to the new
	ListMessenger 2.1.0 directory.

7)	Open your browser and head directly to ListMessenger's index.php page;
	the database changes will be automatically applied and you should receive
	a message that says: "Congratulations, you have successfully upgraded
	to ListMessenger 2.1.0."

	This could take a few seconds as indexes are being added, please be patient.

FINALLY)
	If you had previously uploaded public/images or public/files you will
	need to copy them to the new public/images and public/files folders.

	After you have verified everything is working, you can delete the old
	"listmessenger_backups" folder that exists as it's no longer needed.
	Please only do this once you have verified everything is working and files
	have been copied successfully.

================================================================================

LONGER VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1)
	Although there is very little work involved in upgrading from ListMessenger
	2.0.x to 2.1.0, I always require that you have a valid backup of your
	ListMessenger database.

	If you do continue without a valid backup and something goes wrong, we may
	not be able to help you restore your existing installation. Make a backup.

STEP 2)
	Please make sure that you have logged out of your existing ListMessenger
	installation, and that you have closed your web-browser. Doing this
	ensures that you have clean session data when you log into ListMessenger
	for your next visit.

STEP 3)
	Now that you have backed up your existing installation's database:

	Login via FTP to your webserver and rename your current listmessenger
	program directory to "listmessenger_backup" or something to that effect.

	In doing this, if something goes wrong, it will be very simple for you to
	revert back to the original version while seeking assistance on the forum.

	Example, if your current listmessenger installation is running at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger

	Rename the listmessenger directory to listmessenger_backup, so that
	it exists (non-functioning of course) at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger_backup

STEP 4)
	Unpack the ListMessenger Pro 2.1.0 distribution file with your favourite
	upzip / untar program and rename the extracted directory to "listmessenger"
	or whatever your previous installations directory was named.

STEP 5)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to the same directory name as your previous ListMessenger installation
	was under, on a web-server which meets the following requirements:
	-> PHP 4.1.2+ (4.3+ highly recommended)
		\_ PHP's short tags must be available.
		\_ PHP 4.3+ is required for importing and exporting.
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MySQL 3.23.23+ (more databases on the way)

	<NOTICE>
	You do not need to upload the "setup.php" file or "setup" directory.
	</NOTICE>

STEP 6)
	The folling directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 7)
	Copy the ListMessenger 2.0.x "config.inc.php" from the
	"listmessenger_backup/includes" directory to the new 2.1.0 "includes"
	directory or just edit the new config.inc.php file with the same vales.

STEP 8)
	Copy the ListMessenger 2.0.x licence key file "key.php" file to the new
	ListMessenger 2.1.0 directory.

STEP 9)
	Open your browser and head directly to ListMessenger's index.php page;
	the database changes will be automatically applied and you should receive
	a message that says: "Congratulations, you have successfully upgraded
	to ListMessenger 2.1.0."

	This could take a few seconds as indexes are being added, please be patient.

FINALLY)
	If you had previously uploaded public/images or public/files you will
	need to copy them to the new public/images and public/files folders.

	After you have verified everything is working, you can delete the old
	"listmessenger_backups" folder that exists as it's no longer needed.
	Please only do this once you have verified everything is working and files
	have been copied successfully.
