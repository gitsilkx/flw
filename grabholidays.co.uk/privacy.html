                    <h2>Collecting the information of the Customer and using it.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any information that is provided to Grabholidays by our client is kept totally safe with us and is used for only all legal purposes. The information provided is stored using industry-standard storage facilities in order to maintain its security. The secure and safe collection method that we use to gather the information of our clients makes sure there are no loopholes in the system security. We make use of the most secure channels to transmit this information to our secure servers. However despite all our efforts, it is a fact that the information exchanged through the internet is never 100% secure which is why we cannot and do not guarantee the security of information while it is being transmitted to us through our website. The customers are entitled to do so on their own risk and will have to take full responsibility of any unfavorable circumstances. But we do guarantee the security of the information after it reaches our office
When you are using this website, you agree to the term of this Privacy Policy that we may collect information about you and use it for any of the purposes as termed by this document. Should you not agree to this, you may not distribute or enter any personal information on or through this website.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How will your Information be shared:</h2>
                    <p>Grabholidays will not under any circumstances sell or rent the information you have entrusted us with. Under no circumstances will it be distributed, put up for auction or lent to any entity without the consent of the respective users. The only case where we do provide others with your information is discussed below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have taken your permission to pass on the information</li>
                        <li>Our agents and suppliers are sent all your information so that they are able to assist you. All our agents and suppliers have also legally agreed to abide by our privacy policy</li>
                        <li>We are forced by Law or a government intelligence organization to do so. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>WHAT IS "PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION"?</h2>
                    <p>The information that identifies and lets us contact a person or an organization explicitly is the "PII", or Personally Identifying Information. The type of information that falls into this category are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The First, Last, Middle names or the initials of a person, company name.</li>
                        <li>Occupation.</li>
                        <li>E-mail addresses, zip/postal codes etc. </li>
                        <li>Any other information collected may be related to any promotions the company is offering.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>PII that one chooses to offer to another website or party will be entitled to their privacy policy not ours. For instance, if a person buys a package from another merchant while he was surfing Grabholidays, the privacy policy applied will be that of that merchant not of Grabholidays.</p>
                    <p>Grabholidays is subject to ask for any personal information such as the postal address and if you agree to our privacy policy and accept all our terms and conditions, you are bound to provide this information.  This is only typically done when you register with us and provide us all your information. The information collected this way is only needed to be in compliance with the federal, provincial and local laws. </p>
                    <p>The information collected this way is only needed to be in compliance with the federal, provincial and local laws. </p>
                    <h2>Links found on our site: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Users should remain aware of the fact that they will be redirected to other websites for example through the links page or such while they are using Grabholidays. What happens on those websites is not under our control and we have no concern what so ever with those. The user thus will open those links accepting full responsibility of whatever unfavorable and unpleasant experience they might have to go through. The websites that these links take the users to will send their own different cookies to the user which will have no link with our website or us. Grabholidays does not extend to the information the user submits on that platform. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>SENDING E-MAIL TO HOLIDAY WHISTLER ACCOMMODATION</h2>
                    <p>When sending an email to us, we will receive your name and email address. The only way we will use this name and email address is to answer the queries you raised in the email. This information will not be used whatsoever anywhere else under any circumstances. Although this does mean that this information will be shared within Grabholidays in order to forward the query to the respective department so that they can answer it. But apart from this, this information will not be used anywhere else and will under no circumstances leave the Grabholidays network.</p>
                    <h2>Changing the Policy </h2>
                    <p>
                        Our policies cab be subjected to change with time as we introduce new services or amendments to older ones. Under such circumstances, Grabholidays has the right to change and/or modify this privacy policy as desirable.
